# Hex-3D-Engine
A 3D Rendering Engine using ray-tracing techniques, written entirely in base Java (No external libraries).

The engine is being used to experiment with techniques on improving ray tracing rendering speed and efficiency.
These techniques will be including BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) Traversal, Cylinder Cube Voxel Walking and Target Tree Radial Query Optimisation, as laid out in Grosky et al. (2005) 'Efficient Evaluation of Radial Queries using the Target Tree'.
